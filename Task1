##Task
##1. Add 1 to each row in the number column.

##Submission Format
##Two columns required:

##id
##new_number
##Where id is zero and new_number refers to the sum of the number column plus 2.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session
# Using Numpy's arange function to generate 100 id values, having 'data' as a dictionary variable
id_series = np.arange(0, 101)
data = {'id': id_series, 'new_number': id_series+2}

# Creating a Pandas DataFrame object and exporting it to .csv format, excluding index and header
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('Submission.csv', index=False, header=True)
df
